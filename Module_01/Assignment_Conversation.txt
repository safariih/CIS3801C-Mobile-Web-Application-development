something must be blocking you from being able to use your localhost

from Darice Corey-Gilbert to everyone:
either your windows settings I mean
to Darice Corey-Gilbert (privately):
Okay, I've done this before on this computer so this is quite strange.
from Darice Corey-Gilbert to everyone:
I'll have to research a bit more
from Darice Corey-Gilbert to everyone:
that's very strange. you have all the correct settings. Obviously I won't penalize you, but you might have to hold off on this part of the assignment. 
from Darice Corey-Gilbert to everyone:
what i can do is have you create a sample db like i showed in the live lecture, and I can import it for you, so you can move forward with setting up your webpage
to Darice Corey-Gilbert (privately):
Okay sounds good. I can do that.
from Darice Corey-Gilbert to everyone:
ok
